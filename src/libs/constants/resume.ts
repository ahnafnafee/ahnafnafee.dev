export const SUMMARY = [
  `I operate at the intersection of three fascinating domains: AI üß†, 3D Computer Graphics üåê, and scalable Cloud Infrastructure ‚òÅÔ∏è. As a Computer Science PhD student at George Mason University, my research is driven by a central ambition: to build the next generation of intuitive and immersive ways for humans to interact with digital worlds.`,
  `But I'm not just a theorist. My journey into deep research began after my time as a co-founder and CTO of a tech startup. There, I led teams in building, launching, and scaling complex products from the ground up. That experience taught me a critical lesson: the most brilliant AI models are only as good as the infrastructure they run on. It gave me a deep, practical expertise in creating robust, production-ready systems.`,
  `This unique background allows me to bridge the critical gap üîó between theory and practice. I don't just design novel AI and graphics concepts; I understand how to deploy and scale them efficiently using modern DevOps principles.`,
  `My core areas of expertise include:`,
  `üß† AI & Graphics: Generative AI, 3D Computer Graphics, Rendering Pipelines, Parameterized Shaders`,
  `üõ†Ô∏è DevOps & Cloud: Kubernetes, OpenShift, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Go, Python, CI/CD, Infrastructure Automation`,
  `üìà Leadership: Technical Product Leadership, Agile Development, Team Building & Management`,
  `I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers, industry pioneers, and anyone passionate about building the future of interactive technology. Let's explore what's next, together! ü§ù`
