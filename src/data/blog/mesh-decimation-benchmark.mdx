This study provides empirical evidence that mesh simplification algorithm selection must be informed by **both** the source topology and the target decimation ratio. Given the widespread use of mesh decimation in game engines, VR/AR applications, and 3D printing pipelines, understanding when to use which algorithm is critical.

## Key Findings

Our results support all three research hypotheses with strong statistical significance:

**Finding 1: Universal Speed Advantage.**
Vertex Clustering is **60–80× faster** than QEM across all conditions ($p < 0.001$). For a typical organic model with 300k vertices, Clustering completes in ~0.03 seconds (suitable for real-time LOD at 60 FPS), while QEM requires ~1.29 seconds (acceptable only for offline preprocessing).

**Finding 2: Topology-Conditional Fidelity.**
QEM's geometric accuracy advantage is **highly conditional**. It offers superior fidelity on organic surfaces (mean Hausdorff Distance = 0.006 vs. 0.013 for Clustering), effectively halving the error. However, it **catastrophically fails** on sparse CAD geometries at 90% decimation (mean HD = 0.034), performing significantly worse than Clustering.

**Finding 3: Stability vs. Optimality Trade-off.**
Clustering exhibits remarkable error stability (coefficient of variation $< 15\%$) across all conditions, whereas QEM's error variance increases by 300% when applied to unsuitable topologies.

## Methodology

We utilized a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ factorial design:

- **Factor 1: Algorithm** — Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation (QEM) vs. Vertex Clustering
- **Factor 2: Mesh Type** — Clean CAD (ModelNet40) vs. Organic Scanned (Thingi10k)
- **Factor 3: Decimation Level** — Moderate (50%) vs. Extreme (90%)

### Datasets

We curated a balanced dataset of **30 models** to mitigate selection bias:

- **Clean CAD**: 15 models from [ModelNet40](https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/). Man-made objects (airplanes, chairs, guitars) with sharp edges, large planar surfaces, and 18k–80k vertices.
- **Organic Scanned**: 15 models from [Thingi10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/). 3D scans of sculptures, animals, and characters with smooth curvatures, 10k–600k vertices, and surface noise typical of scanning.

### Metrics

1. **Execution Time**: Wall-clock time with warm-up runs and 5 measured repetitions using `time.perf_counter_ns()`
2. **Geometric Fidelity**: Two-sided Hausdorff Distance $\max(d(A,B), d(B,A))$, measuring maximum deviation between original mesh $A$ and simplified mesh $B$

### Statistical Analysis

Three-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, 95% confidence intervals. Total of **120 observations** across the factorial design.

## Algorithm Background

### Quadric Error Metrics (QEM)

QEM is a high-quality decimation algorithm that iteratively collapses edges to minimize geometric error. Each face incident to a vertex defines a plane, and the error at a vertex is the sum of squared distances to all incident planes:

$$\Delta(v) = v^T Q v$$

where $Q$ is a symmetric $4 \times 4$ matrix. For an edge collapse $(v_1, v_2) \to \bar{v}$, the new vertex inherits combined quadrics:

$$\bar{Q} = Q_1 + Q_2$$

The optimal placement minimizes $\bar{v}^T \bar{Q} \bar{v}$.

**Complexity**: $O(n \log n)$ due to priority queue maintenance.

### Vertex Clustering

Vertex Clustering is a fast, low-memory technique using spatial hashing:

1. Compute bounding box and divide into uniform 3D grid cells
2. Map each vertex to cell index: $\text{cell}(v) = \lfloor (v - v_{\min}) / \delta \rfloor$
3. Collapse all vertices within a cell to representative vertex
4. Remove degenerate faces

**Complexity**: $O(n)$ with constant-time bin assignments.

### Execution Time Analysis

The three-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant main effect for Algorithm:

$$F(1,112) \approx 22.89, \quad p < 0.001$$

The **Algorithm × Mesh Type interaction** was also significant ($F(1,112) \approx 10.09$, $p = 0.002$):
- Clustering: under 0.05s regardless of input complexity
- QEM: 0.26s (CAD) → 1.29s (Organic) — a **~40× performance gap**

This gap arises from QEM's priority queue maintenance requiring $O(\log n)$ heap updates per edge collapse, whereas Clustering performs constant-time spatial hashing.

### Geometric Fidelity Analysis

Significant effects for Algorithm ($p=0.008$), Mesh Type ($p=0.011$), and Decimation Level ($p=0.001$). The **Algorithm × Type interaction** was significant ($p=0.004$).

**Critical finding**: QEM catastrophically fails on CAD models at 90% decimation.

Failure case analysis:
- **Wing Collapse (Airplane Model)**: QEM eliminates thin planar surfaces defining wings—quadric error cannot distinguish "safe" interior edges from silhouette-critical boundaries
- **Leg Detachment (Chair Model)**: Supporting columns with 200–300 vertices disappear as QEM prioritizes the larger seat surface

Clustering's voxelization maintains coarse volumetric approximation—appearing "blocky" but preserving global topology.

### Effect Size Analysis

Cohen's $d$ confirms practical significance:

**Execution Time:**
- Algorithm effect: $d = 0.81$ (large)
- Mesh Type effect: $d = 0.54$ (medium)
- Algorithm × Type interaction: $d = 1.04$ (very large)

**Hausdorff Distance:**
- QEM on CAD vs. Clustering on CAD at 90%: $d = 0.98$ (very large)

---

## Practical Recommendations

- **Real-time VR/AR**: Use Clustering exclusively ($<16$ms frame budget)
- **Offline CAD simplification at 90%**: Prefer Clustering to avoid topological collapse
- **High-fidelity organic reduction at 50%**: QEM provides optimal surface preservation
- **Unknown topology pipelines**: Implement hybrid routing based on vertex density

The "one-size-fits-all" approach is suboptimal. Future pipelines should incorporate **topology detection** as preprocessing to route meshes to algorithm-appropriate strategies.

---

## Limitations

- **Non-normality**: Shapiro-Wilk tests revealed deviations ($W \approx 0.53$, $p < 0.001$). ANOVA is generally robust, but p-values should be interpreted with caution.
- **Sample Size**: $N=120$ (30 models × 2 algorithms × 2 decimation levels)
- **Single Error Metric**: Only Hausdorff Distance measured
