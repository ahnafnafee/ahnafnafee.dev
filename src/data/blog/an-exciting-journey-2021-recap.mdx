## Introspection, a self-awareness

Starting 2021 is tough and a lot of things have happened.
First, before I jumped into the programming world, I was a person who likes to play **MMORPG games**, my daily activities are just playing games in front of my computer, sometimes I don't sleep but just playing games all day.

But then I realized myself with my family situation, yep.. I was born in a poor family, even though I entered in Software Engineering field when I was in High School, but then a pandemic was appeared and school activities has totally stopped, because of this, I started to find a new hobbies, like playing games.

In February, I decided to stop playing games, and started exploring Web Development related field, because as I said before, I choose Software Engineering when I was in High School, and I got plenty background from there when I was in _10th_ grade.

## Become a Lost Sheep

Soon it would be end of February, I'm still following the tutorial without a direction, where I learned the basics of HTML at [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com/) and without a mentor or even a roadmap, I was totally blind, I can't even create a _Hidden Nav Menu_ LOLðŸ˜‚.

I didn't stop there, I continued to learn CSS, and this is where I fell in love with Frontend Web Development, because to be honest, I actually works well with design, but I can't use tools like Adobe Photoshop, but when I make some line of code using CSS, the website looks good and exactly same with what I want.

## A New Sign Of Light

After about 2 Months of being a **lost sheep**, I also found a very cool YouTube channel, [Web Programming UNPAS](https://youtube.com/c/WebProgrammingUNPAS). On that YouTube channel I learned a lot, there is a playlist for Frontend Developers, so I started again from scratch, I also followed the Frontend Developer roadmap based on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), starting with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Strengthening My Background, Taking Courses

Internet is a secondary home for me, there is a lot of information available by just accessing my smartphone, not only that, I only got helpful information that allow me to take a paid course, but with free access lifetime, isn't it awesome?.

I'm a person who likes to _surf_ on social media, not only for entrertainment purpose, but I search for useful information, sharing with others, I can meet good people everyday and it's something else.

## Dicoding Academy

Dicoding is a leading technology education platform that encourages wider access to digital literacy for everyone. Dicoding has a mission to accelerate Indonesia's transition to a digital world through technology education that transforms lives.

I am very happy that I can get access to paid courses for free at Dicoding academy, there are lots of classes, when I got the scholarship, I took Frontend roamdap, including:

1. [Belajar Dasar Pemrograman Web](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/123)

2. [Belajar Membuat Frontend Untuk Web Untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/315)

3. [Belajar Fundamental Frontend Web Development](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/163)

## Progate Academy

Progate is an easy-to-use platform designed to help learn coding online, and at Progate I learned a lot, not only Web Development, but I also learned other things like Python and Git.

## React and NEXT.js

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

In mid-June, I started to encourage myself to learn React, as you may know, JSX are very complicated, especially for a beginner.

At first I was really confused, I'm actually wanted to quit to learn React, but because of my hard work and watching lots of videos on YouTube, I finally knew how to write JSX and make a Web with React.

```js
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

Then in August, I tried to learn [next.js](https://nextjs.org), a framework built on top of React, it has many features such as built-in routing, and file-based routing.

Now I'm more comfortable with next.js, and then on October, I learned TypeScript, and I feel so comfortable with NEXT.js + TypeSCript.

## Hacktoberfest And GetHired DevCode

On October, I participated in an event held by Developer around the world. it was Hacktoberfest, and I never heard about this before, and this is actually my first time to be a participant in Hacktoberfest.

The lesson that I got while participating in Hacktoberfest is that I can understand the concept of collaboration between developers by using Git.

Then I took part in the Frontend Challenge event held by [Skyshi](https://skyshi.com) and [Gethired Devcode](https://blog.gethired.id/devcode/).

A very exciting event, and there was so many people participated in this event, we were required to create a [SPA-Based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) Web Application that focuses on performance.

When I participated in this event, I only won the 13th place out of more than 30 people participated, and I'm proud of myself because I was able to get the result **because of me**.

From this event, I learned something useful, like how to create an optimize app, managing state, and lazy loading a component.

## Dreams Come True

At the end of 2021, I received a good news, I was invited to take part in an interview from SkyshiðŸ¤¯, who's previously held the GetHired DevCode Event.

Then 2 days after the interview, I got welcomed as Jr. Frontend Developer at Skyshi.

Becoming a Frontend Developer is a dream of mine since I was in High School, this certainly makes me happy, work as same as my passion is something I look forward to.
