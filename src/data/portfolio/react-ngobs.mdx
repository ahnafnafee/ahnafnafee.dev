React Ngobs is a Chat App that I was built when I was learned Firebase, according to Google, Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

I don't know about the others, but many of my friends are using Firebase for backend purpose or BaaS (Backend as a Service), and you can checkout [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), an alternative of Firebase.
