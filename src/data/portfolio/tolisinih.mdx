Tolisinih is a todo app based on [GetHired DevCode Challenge #1](https://blog.gethired.id/devcode-challenge-1st/).

It represent basic CRUD application, and also there is data manipulation, the challenge is fun and competitive,
challenger should be able to create an app that will **create, read, update,** and **delete** activities.

the data we should populate to the UI are:

```ts
interface Todo {
  title: string
  priority: 'very low' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'very high'
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}

interface Activity {
  title: string
  todo: Array<Todo>
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}
```

Has 2 pages, the first page is homepage which is the first content user would see, the homepage will display a list of activity items, and it's _clickable_.

When user click one of the activity items, user will be redirected to pages where a list of todos appear from the selected activity, and the routes of the app would be like:

```bash
https://tolisinih.web.app/detail/:slug
```
