## Overview

TimeKour is a retro-wave themed game with parkour mechanics. This includes Wall Run, High Jumps and also Grappling.
Your objective will be to run across the obstacles and kill all enemies in each level. Bullets in this world move
slowly so it will give you time to dodge and weave while performing some cool stunts to defeat your enemies.

## Responsibilities

- This was a solo indie project that I completed from scratch in one month. My primary motivation of the idea came
  from Mirror’s Edge. I developed the first-person controller which utilized the basic parkour mechanics using
  a grappler.

- I got exposure to FMOD while developing this game. I heavily utilized the options offered by the software to mix
  and add tracks into my game to spice up the gameplay.

- Another game mechanic I added into the game was SuperHot’s slow bullet time. Basically, I added the ability to
  freeze time to dodge enemy bullets while performing parkour.
