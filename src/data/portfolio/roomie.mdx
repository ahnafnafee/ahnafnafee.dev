## Overview

Bookworm is an app that works similarly to the Tinder app, where instead of matching with a potential partner,
the user will be able to match with a potential roommate. It is targeted towards college students people are looking
for roommates. They are able to input their major, hobbies, and other preferences as well as their school or their
general location where they are looking for roommates. The app will then generate potential roommates with similar
interests for the user to match with, and the user can decide whether they want to reach out to their matches or not.
