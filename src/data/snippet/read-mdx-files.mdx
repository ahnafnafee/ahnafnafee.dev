## Read Mdx File

To read Mdx file, first locate where the mdx files are stored by targeting its folder

```js
// in my case: src/data/blog
import * as fs from 'fs/promises'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import * as path from 'path'

// notice I only target it's parent folder (data) in case there is another
// mdx content that I want to store aside from blog post
const folder = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src/data')

export const getContentBySlug = async (path, slug) => {
  // read path to file src/data/{path}/[{slug}].mdx
  const dir = join(`${folder}/${path}`, `${slug}.mdx`)
  // read file with promise based
  const file = await readFile(dir, 'utf8')

  // parse file content with gray matter, extract it's header and content
  const { content, data } = matter(file)

  return {
    // in case we need the file name as slug, example usage is for the url page
    header: { ...data, slug },
    content
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Implementation

```ts
type Content<T> = {
  header: T & { slug: string }
  content: string
}

export const getContentBySlug = async <T>(path: string, slug: string): Promise<Content<T>> => {
  const dir = join(`${folder}/${path}`, `${slug}.mdx`)

  const file = await readFile(dir, 'utf8')
  const { content, data } = matter(file)

  return {
    header: { ...(data as T), slug },
    content
  }
}
```

## Usage

To read your mdx file, simply call it with giving it two argument:

1. The folder where the mdx is stored
2. the file name itself

```js
// notice I don't need to prefix the first parameter to be `/blog`
// or the second paramter to be `my-first-post.mdx`
const post = await getContentBySlug('blog', 'my-first-post')
```

### Usage in TypeScript

Previously the function require one generic type, so the usage will be like so

```ts
type Post = {
    title: string
    published_at: string
    author: string
}

const post = await getContentBySlug<Post>('blog', 'my-first-post')

/**
 * post will be:
 * const post = {
 *  header: { title: string; published_at: string; author: string; slug: string }
 *  content: string
 * }
 */
```
